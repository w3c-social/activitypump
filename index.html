        The ActivityPub protocol is a social networking protocol based upon the
        ActivityStreams 2.0 data format.
        It is based upon experience gained from implementing and working with
        the OStatus and Pump.io protocols.

    <section id="Overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The ActivityPub protocol is broadly based on the distribution of
        <i>activities</i>, described using [[!ActivityStreams]]; these
        activities are produced in response to a user performing an activity.
        Most activities are purely responsive in nature - they are produced as
        a response to a user having <em>done</em> something.
        In addition, certain activities posted by a user to their
        <a href="#outbox">outbox</a> may trigger certain operations on the
        user's behalf.
        Finally, activities may have side effects as they propagate throughout
        the social graph.
        As an example of this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A user posts the <code>like</code> activity to their outbox.
          This activity causes the user's server to perform an activity on
          behalf of the user; in particular, it adds the specified object to
          the collection of objects the user has liked.
        </li>
        <li>
          A consequence of the above activity (per
          <a href="#targeting"></a>) is that the server hosting the liked
          object will be notified of the operation, and will normally add the
          activity to the list of "likes" the object has received.
          (ActivityPub makes use of
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#audienceTargeting">
            ActivityStreams' audience targeting facilities</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the server receiving the like will distribute this activity
          to everyone it distributed the original object to.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

      </p>

      <section id="specification-profiles">
        <h2>Specification Profiles</h2>
        <p>
          This specification defines two closely related and interacting
          protocols:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>A client to server protocol, or "Social API"</dt>
          <dd>
            This protocol permits a client to act <i>on behalf</i> of a user.
            For example, this protocol is used by a mobile phone application to
            interact with the user's social stream.
          </dd>
          <dt>A server to server protocol, or "Federation Protocol"</dt>
          <dd>
            This protocol is used to distribute activities between users on
            different servers, tying them into one social graph.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          All servers claiming conformance to this specification are required to
          implement the former protocol, and may optionally implement the latter.
          This gives three conformance classes:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Client</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            client portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            server portion of the client to server protocol.
          </dd>
          <dt>ActivityPub conformant Federated Server</dt>
          <dd>
            This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of the
            server portion of both the client to server and federation protocols.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
          to implementation of the federation protocol.
          In addition, whenever requirements are specified, it is called out
          whether they apply to the client or server (for the client-to-server
          protocol) or which of a pair of servers in the server-to-server
          protocol.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="cr-exit-criteria">
        <h2>Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          For this specification to advance to Proposed Recommendation, there
          must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of
          each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
          products. There is no requirement that all features be implemented by
          a single product.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Independent</strong>
            implementations are developed by different parties and cannot
            share, reuse or derive from another qualifying implementation code
            which is directly pertinent to the implementation of this
            specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interoperability</strong>
            occurs between clients and servers, or between servers and other
            servers, when the client/server makes a request to the targeted
            server, and the targeted server sends the expected response, as
            defined by this specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <strong>implementation</strong> is an ActivityPub client,
            server or federated server which implements the corresponding
            conformance class of the specification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, each of the following
          is considered a feature:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Discovering an actor's profile based on their URI.
          </li>
          <li>
            A client receiving authorization and subsequently submitting an
            activity to the authenticated actor's outbox.
          </li>
          <li>
            A server handling an activity submitted by an authenticated actor
            to their outbox and handling client to server interaction
            side effects appropriately.
          </li>
          <li>
            A federated server delivering an activity posted by a local actor
            to the inbox endpoints of all recipients specified in the activity,
            including those on other remote federated servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            A federated server receiving an activity to its actor's inbox,
            validating that the activity and any nested objects were created by
            their respective actors, and handling server to server side effects
            appropriately.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="atrisk">
        <h2>At Risk features</h2>
        <p>
          The Working Group has marked the following features as At
          Risk and may seek to advance the specification with the
          removal of these features if insufficient implementation
          experience can be gathered.

      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects are the core concept around which both [[!ActivityStreams]] and
        ActivityPub are built.
        Objects are often wrapped in Activities and are contained in streams of
        Collections, which are themselves subclasses of Objects.
        See the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/">
          Activity Vocabulary</a>
        document, particularly the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#types">Core Classes</a>,
        to get a sense of how this lays out; ActivityPub follows the mapping of
        this vocabulary very closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ActivityPub defines some terms in addition to those provided by
        ActivityStreams.
        These terms are provided in the ActivityPub
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>
        at
        <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams</code>.
        Implementers SHOULD include the ActivityPub context in their
        object definitions.
        Implementers MAY include additional context as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        ActivityPub shares the same
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#urls">
          URI / IRI conventions as in ActivityStreams</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servers SHOULD validate the content they receive to avoid content
        spoofing attacks.
        In particular, servers SHOULD NOT trust client submitted content, and
        federated servers also SHOULD NOT trust content received from a server
        other than the content's origin without some form of verification.
        No particular mechanism for verification is authoritively specified by
        this document, though some possible directions are discussed in
        <a href="#authorization"></a>.
        (A server should do something at least as robust as checking that
        the object appears as received at its origin, but better mechanisms
        such as checking signatures would be better if available.)
      </p>
      <div class="informative">
        As an example, if example.com receives the activity
        <pre class="example">
         {
           "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
           "type": "Like",
           "actor": "https://example.net/~mallory",
           "to": ["https://hatchat.example/sarah/",
                  "https://example.com/peeps/john/"],
           "object": {
             "@context": {"@language": "en"},
             "id": "https://example.org/~alice/note/23",
             "type": "Note",
             "author": "https://example.org/~alice",
             "content": "I'm a goat"
           }
         }
        </pre>
        it should dereference the <code>id</code> both to ensure that it exists
        and is a valid object, and that it is not misrepresenting the object.
        (In this example, Mallory could be spoofing an object allegedly posted
        by Alice.)
      </div>
      <section id="obj-id">
        <h2>Object Identifiers</h2>
        <p>
          All Objects in [[!ActivityStreams]] should have unique global
          identifiers.
          ActivityPub extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the
          ActivityPub protocol MUST have unique global identifiers; these
          identifiers must fall into one of the following groups:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Publicly dereferencable URIs, such as HTTPS URIs, with their
            authority belonging to that of their originating server.
            (Publicly facing content SHOULD use HTTPS URIs.)
          </li>
          <li>
            An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object,
            which implies an anonymous object (a part of its parent context)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Identifiers MUST be provided for activities posted in server to
          server communication.
          However, for client to server communication, a server receiving an
          object with no specified <code>id</code> SHOULD allocate an object ID
          in the user's namespace and attach it to the posted object.
        </p>
        <p>All objects must have the following properties:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>id</dt><dd>The object's unique global identifier</dd>
          <dt>type</dt><dd>The type of the object</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section id="retrieving-objects">
        <h2>Retrieving objects</h2>
        <p>
          The HTTP GET method may be dereferenced against an object's
          <code>id</code> property to retrieve the activity.
          Servers MAY use HTTP content negotiation as defined in [[!RFC7231]] to
          select the type of data to return in response to a request,
          but MUST present the ActivityStreams object representation
          in response to
          <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#"</code>,
          and SHOULD also present the ActivityStreams representation in
          response to <code>application/activity+json</code> as well.
          The client MUST specify an <code>Accept</code> header with the
          <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#"</code>
          media type in order to retrieve the activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Servers MAY implement other behavior for requests which do not comply
          with the above requirement.
          (For example, servers may implement additional legacy protocols, or
          may use the same URI for both HTML and ActivityStreams
          representations of a resource)
        </p>
        <p>
          Servers MAY require authorization as specified in

          own authorization rules.
          Servers SHOULD fail requests which do not pass their authorization
          checks with the appropriate HTTP error code, or the 403 Forbidden
          error code where the existence of the object is considered private.
          An origin server which does not wish to disclose the existence of
          a private target MAY instead respond with a status code of

        <h2>The source property</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to all the properties defined by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/">
            Activity Vocabulary</a>,
          ActivityPub extends the <code>Object</code> by supplying the
          <code>source</code> property.
          The <code>source</code> property is intended to convey some
          sort of source from which the <code>content</code> markup
          was derived, as a form of provenance, or to support future
          editing by clients.
          In general, clients do the conversion from <code>source</code>
          to <code>content</code>, not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of <code>source</code> is itself an object
          which uses its own <code>content</code> and <code>mediaType</code>
          fields to supply source information.
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
          {
            "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",

        <div class="note"
             title="What to do when clients can't meaningfully handle a mediaType?">
          <p>
            In general, it's best to let a user edit their original post
            in the same source format they originally composed it in.
            But not all clients can reliably provide a nice interface for
            all source types, and since clients are expected to do the
            conversion from <code>source</code> to <code>content</code>,
            some clients may work with a media type that another client
            does not know how to work with.
            While a client could feasibly provide the <code>content</code>
            markup to be edited and ignore the source, this means that the
            user will lose the more desirable form of the original
            <code>source</code> in any future revisions.
            A client doing so should thus provide a minimally obtrusive warning
            cautioning that the original source format is not understood and is
            thus being ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Alyssa P. Hacker likes to post to her ActivityPub
            powered blog via an Emacs client she has written, leveraging
            <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>.
            Later she switches to editing on her phone's client, which
            has no idea what <code>text/x-org</code> is or how to render
            it to HTML, so it provides a text box to edit the original
            <code>content</code> instead.
            A helpful warning displays above the edit area saying,
            "This was originally written in another markup language we don't
            know how to handle.  If you edit, you'll lose your original
            source!"
            Alyssa decides the small typo fix isn't worth losing her nice
            org-mode markup and decides to make the update when she gets
            home.

      <h2>Actors</h2>
      <p>
        Actors are ActivityStreams Objects, generally one of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#actor-types">
          ActivityStreams Actor Types</a>,
        and are <a href="#retrieving-objects">retrieved</a> like any other
        Object in ActivityPub.
        Like other ActivityStreams objects, actors have an <code>id</code>,
        which is a URI.
        When entered directly into a user interface (for example on a login
        form), it is desirable to support simplified naming.
        For this purpose cases, ID normalization SHOULD be performed as
        follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          If it appears that the user neglected to add a scheme for a URI that
          would otherwise be considered valid, such as
          <code>example.org/alice/</code>, clients MAY attempt to provide
          a default scheme, preferably <code>https</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Once the actor's URI has been identified, it should be dereferenced.

      <h2>Collections</h2>
      <p>
        [[!ActivityStreams]] defines the collection concept; ActivityPub
        defines several collections with special behavior.
        Note that ActivityPub makes use of
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#paging">
          ActivityStreams paging</a>
        to traverse large sets of objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that some of these collections are specified to be of type
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#OrderedCollection">
          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>
        specifically, while others are permitted to be either a
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#OrderedCollection">
          <code>Collection</code></a>
        or an
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#OrderedCollection">
          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>.
        An
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#OrderedCollection">
          <code>OrderedCollection</code></a>
        MUST be presented consistently in reverse chronological order.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        What property is used to determine the reverse chronological order
        is intentionally left as an implementation detail.
        For example, many SQL-style databases use an incrementing integer
        as an identifier, which can be reasonably used for handling
        insertion order in most cases.
        In other databases, an insertion time timestamp may be preferred.
        What is used isn't important, but the ordering of elements must
        remain intact, with newer items first.
        A property which changes regularly, such a "last updated" timestamp,
        should not be used.

          If a user submits a request without

        <p>
          The inbox is discovered through the <code>inbox</code>

        </p>

        <p>
          The inbox stream contains all objects received by the
          user.
          The server SHOULD filter content according to the requester's
          permission.
          In general, the owner of an inbox is likely to be able to access
          all of their inbox contents. Depending on access control, some
          other content may be public, whereas other content may require
          authentication for non-owner users, if they can access the inbox
          at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          The server MUST perform de-duplication of activities returned by
          the inbox. Duplication can occur if an activity is addressed both 
          to a user's followers, and a specific
          user who also follows the recipient user, and the server has failed
          to de-duplicate the recipients list.
          Such deduplication MUST be performed by comparing the
          <code>id</code> of the activities and dropping any activities
          already seen.

        <h2>Public Addressing</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to [[!ActivityStreams]] collections and objects,
          Activities may additionally be addressed to the special "public"
          collection, with the identifier
          <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public</code>.
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
          {
            "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",

        <p>
          Activities addressed to this special URI shall be accessible to all

      <h2>Binary Data</h2>
      <p>
        There is the ability to submit binary data such as images, video or
        other binary data you wish to use in ActivityPub.
        This is done by means of submitting the binary data to the user's
        <a href="#uploadMedia"><code>uploadMedia</code></a> on their
        ActivityStreams profile object.
        The request MUST contain the HTTP headers <code>Content-Type</code> and
        <code>Content-Length</code>.
        A client should expect that it must be properly authenticated in order
        to be able to upload media.
        Upon successful submission a response containing the object with an ID
        is returned that can be posted to the user's outbox.
      </p>

      <p>An example response for an image I might upload is:</p>
      <pre class="example">
        {

    <section id="client-to-server-interactions">
      <h2>Client to Server Interactions</h2>
      <p>
        Activities as defined by [[!ActivityStreams]] are the core mechanism
        for creating, modifying and sharing content within the social graph.
        Client to server interaction takes place through clients posting
        activities to a user's <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: right..?? -->
        <strong>Clients</strong> are responsible for addressing new Activites
        appropriately.
        To some extent, this is dependent upon the particular client
        implementation, but clients must be aware that the server will only
        forward new Activities to addressees in the <code>to</code>,
        <code>cc</code> and <code>bcc</code> fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients MAY address new Activities to the user's
        <a href="#followers">Followers Collection</a>
        and/or the <a href="#public-addressing">Public Collection</a> by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients SHOULD check any objects attached to the Activity via the 
        <code>object</code>, <code>target</code>, <code>inReplyTo</code> and/or 
        <code>tag</code> fields, retrieve <em>their</em> <code>actor</code> or 
        <code>attributedTo</code> properties, and MAY also retrieve their addressing 
        properties, and add these to the <code>to</code> or <code>cc</code> 
        fields of the new Activity being created.
        Clients MAY recurse through attached objects, but if doing so, SHOULD
        set a limit for this recursion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clients MAY give the user the chance to amend this addressing in the 
        UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when Chris likes the following article by Amy:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="An Article">

  "to": "<strong>https://rhiaro.co.uk/followers/</strong>", 
  "cc": "<strong>https://e14n.com/evan</strong>"
}
      </pre>

      <p>the like is generated by the client as:</p>

      <pre class="example" title="A Like of the Article">
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
               {"@language": "en"}],

  "cc": "<strong>https://e14n.com/evan</strong>"
}
      </pre>

      <p>The receiving outbox can then perform <a href="#delivery">delivery</a>
      to not only the followers of Chris (the liker), but also to Amy, and Amy's
      followers and Evan, both of whom received the original article.</p>

      <p>
        To submit new Activities to a user's server, clients MUST discover
        the URL of the user's <strong><a href="#outbox">outbox</a></strong> 
        from their <a href="#actor-objects">profile</a> and then MUST make an 
        HTTP <code>POST</code> request to to this URL with the Content-Type of
        <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#"</code>.
        The request MUST be authenticated with the credentials of the user to 
        whom the outbox belongs.
        The body of the <code>POST</code> request MUST contain a single
        Activity (which MAY contain embedded objects), or a single non-Activity
        object which
        <a href="#object-without-create">will be wrapped in a Create activity
          by the server</a>.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Submitting an Activity to the Outbox">
POST /outbox/ HTTP/1.1
Host: dustycloud.org
Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Type: application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#"

}
      </pre>
      <p>
        If an Activity is submitted with a value in the <code>id</code> 
        property, servers MUST ignore this and generate a new <code>id</code>
        for the Activity.
        Servers MUST return a <code>201 Created</code> HTTP code with the new
        URL in the <code>Location</code> header.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Outbox response to submitted Activity">
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://dustycloud.org/likes/345
      </pre>
      <p>
        The server adds this new Activity to the <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>
        collection. 
        Depending on the type of Activity, servers may then be required to 
        carry out further side effects.
        These are described per individual Activity below.
      </p>

      <section id="create-activity-outbox">
        <h3>Create Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Create</code> activity is used to when posting a new object.
          This has the side effect that the object embedded within the Activity
          (in the <code>object</code> property) is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a <code>Create</code> activity is posted, the <code>actor</code>
          of the activity SHOULD be copied onto the <code>object</code>'s
          <code>attributedTo</code> field.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mismatch between addressing of the Create activity and its
          <code>object</code> is likely to lead to confusion.
          As such, a server SHOULD copy any recipients of the Create activity
          to its <code>object</code> upon initial distribution, and likewise
          with copying recipients from the <code>object</code> to the wrapping
          Create activity.
          Note that it is acceptable for the <code>object</code>'s addressing
          may be changed later without changing the <code>Create</code>'s
          addressing (for example via an <code>Update</code> activity).
        </p>

        <section id="object-without-create">
        <h4>Object creation without a Create Activity</h4>
        <p>
          For client to server posting, it is possible to create a new object
          without a surrounding activity.
          The server MUST accept a valid [[!ActivityStreams]] object that
          isn't a subtype of <code>Activity</code> in the POST request to the 
          outbox.
          The server then MUST attach this object as the <code>object</code>
          of a <a href="#create-activity-outbox">Create Activity</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          The <code>Location</code> value returned by the server should be the URL of 
          the new Create activity (rather than the object).
        </p>

        <p>
          The audience specified on the object MUST be copied over to
          the new Create activity by the server.
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Object with audience targeting">
        {
          "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                       {"@language": "en"}],

          "cc": ["https://example.com/~erik/followers"]
        }
        </pre>

        The above example could be converted to this:

      <section id="update-activity-outbox">
        <h3>Update Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Update</code> activity is used when updating an already
          existing object.
          The side effect of this is that the <code>object</code> MUST be 
          modified to reflect the new structure as defined in the update 
          activity, assuming the actor has permission to update this
          object.
          For client to server interactions, updates are partial;
          rather than updating the document all at once, any key value
          pair supplied is used to replace the existing value with
          the new value.
          A special exception is for when the value is the json
          <code>null</code> type; this means that this field should be
          removed from the server's representation of the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this behavior is for client to server interaction where
          the client is posting to the server only.
          Server to server interaction and updates from the server to the client
          should contain the entire new representation of the object, after
          the partial update application has been applied.
          See the description of the
          <a href="#update-activity-inbox">Update activity for server to server
            interactions</a>

      <section id="delete-activity-outbox">
        <h3>Delete Activity</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Delete</code> activity is used to delete an already
          existing object.
          The side effect of this is that the server MAY replace the
          <code>object</code> with a <code>Tombstone</code> of the object 
          that will be displayed in activities which reference the deleted
          object.
          If the deleted object is requested the server SHOULD respond with
          either the HTTP 410 Gone status code if a <code>Tombstone</code>
          object is presented as the response body, otherwise respond with a
          HTTP 404 Not Found.

          The undo activity and the activity being undone MUST both have the

          Side effects should be undone, to the extent possible.
          For example, if undoing a <code>Like</code>, any counter that had

      <h2>Server to Server Interactions</h2>
      <p>
        Servers communicate with other servers and propagate information across
        the social graph by posting activities to actors'
        <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> endpoints.
        An Activity sent over the network SHOULD have an <code>id</code>,
        unless it is intended to be transient (in which case it MAY omit the
        <code>id</code> or use a fragment identifier).
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to propagate updates throughout the social graph, Activities
        are sent to the appropriate recipients.
        First, these recipients are determined through following the
        appropriate links between objects until you reach an agent
        (<a href="#targeting">targeting</a>), and then the Activity is inserted
        into the agent's <em>inbox</em> (<a href="#delivery">delivery</a>).
        This allows recipient servers to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          conduct any side effects related to the Activity (for example,
          notification that a user has liked an object is used to update the

        <h2>Targeting</h2>
        <p>
          Primary targeting is per the audience targeting properties from the
          [[!ActivityStreams]] specification.
          Notification targeting ensures the owners of all linked objects are
          notified of a new Activity that relates to them.
          Thus, the target(s) for delivery of an Activity may be:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primary targeting:</strong> the values of the
            <code>to</code>, <code>cc</code> or <code>bcc</code> fields (likely
            to include the <a href="#followers">followers</a> collection)
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Notification targeting:</strong> the <code>actors</code>
            for all objects in the <code>object</code>, <code>target</code>,
            <code>inReplyTo</code> or <code>tag</code> fields
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If the entry is a collection, then the server MUST dereference the
          collection (with the user's credentials) and discover inboxes for
          each item in the collection.
          Servers MUST limit the number of layers of indirections through
          collections which will be performed, which MAY be one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Servers MUST de-duplicate the final recipient list. Servers MUST also
          exclude actors from the list which are the same as the <code>actor</code>
          of the Activity being notified about.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Silent and private activities">
          What to do when there are no recipients specified is not defined,
          however it's recommended that if no recipients are specified the
          object remains completely private and access controls restrict the
          access to object.
          If the object is just sent to the "public" collection the object is
          not delivered to any users but is publicly viewable in the actor's
          outbox.

      <section id="delivery">
        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          An activity is delivered to its targets (which are
          <a href="#actors">actors</a>) by first looking up the targets'
          inboxes and then posting the activity to those inboxes.
          The <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> property is determined by first
          <a href="#retrieving-objects">
            retrieving the target actor's json-ld representation</a>
          and then looking up the <code>inbox</code> property.
          An HTTP POST request (with authorization of the submitting user) is
          then made to to the <a href="#inbox">inbox</a>, with the Activity as
          the body of the request.
          This Activity is added by the receiver as an <code>item</code> in the
          <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> OrderedCollection.
        </p>

        <p>
          For federated servers performing delivery to a 3rd party server,
          delivery SHOULD be performed asynchronously, and SHOULD additionally
          retry delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Relationship to Linked Data Notifications">
          While it is not required reading to understand this specification,
          it is worth noting that ActivityPub's targeting and delivery
          mechanism overlaps with the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a>
          specification, and the two specifications may interoperably
          combined.
          In particular, the <code>inbox</code> property is the same between
          ActivityPub and Linked Data Notifications, and the targeting
          and delivery systems described in this document are supported
          by Linked Data Notifications.
          In addition to json-ld compacted ActivityStreams documents, Linked
          Data Notifications also supports a number of RDF serializations
          which are not required for ActivityPub implementations.
          However, ActivityPub implementations which wish to be more broadly
          compatible with Linked Data Notifications implementations may wish to
          support other RDF representations.

              The server SHOULD recurse through these values to look for linked objects

              pick up any new addressees whilst recursing through the linked objects

        <section id="public-inbox-delivery">
          <h2>Public Inbox Delivery</h2>
          <p>
            For servers hosting many actors, delivery to all participants can
            result in an overwhelming number of messages sent.
            Some servers would also like to display a list of all messages
            posted publicly to the "known network".
            Thus ActivityPub provides an optional mechanism for serving these
            two use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            When an origin server is sending an activity to a remote server
            which is addressed with the special
            <a href="#public-addressing">Public</a>
            recipient, the origin server MAY reduce the number of actors
            delivered to by identifying all actors which would be recipients
            who share a
            <a href="publicInbox">publicInbox</a>
            who would otherwise be individual recipients and instead deliver
            to only <code>publicInbox</code> objects.
            (An origin server MAY alternately decide to publish all posts
            to all <code>publicInbox</code> endpoints known.)
            The server with the receiving <code>publicInbox</code> should
            use its own <a href="#following">following lists</a> to determine
            which actors should have the post delivered to their inbox.
            Thus in this scenario, the remote/receiving server participates
            in determining targeting and performing delivery to specific
            inboxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Origin servers sending publicly addressed activities to
            <code>publicInbox</code> endpoints MUST still deliver to actors
            and collections otherwise addressed (through <code>to</code>,
            <code>cc</code>, and <code>bcc</code>) which do not have a
            <code>publicInbox</code> and would not otherwise receive

          object truly was posted by this actor, and signed HTTP messages
          should be used when authentication or authorization is ephemeral.)
          This has the advantage of clean integration with existing json-ld

          However, at the time of specification, Linked Data Signatures and

      <section id="security-verification">
        <h2>Verification and authorization</h2>
        <p>
          Servers should be careful to verify that new content is really posted
          by the author that claims to be posting it, and that the author has
          permission to update the resources it claims to.
          Discussion of how to accomplish this is laid out in the
          <a href="#obj"></a> and <a href="#authorization"></a> sections.

      <section id="security-localhost">
        <h2>Accessing localhost URIs</h2>
        <p>
          It is often convenient while developing to test against a process
          running on localhost.
          However, permitting requests to localhost in a production client or
          server instance can be dangerous.
          Making requests to URIs on localhost which do not require
          authorization may unintentionally access or modify resources assumed
          to be protected to be usable by localhost-only.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your ActivityPub server or client does permit making requests to
          localhost URIs for development purposes, consider making it a
          configuration option which defaults to off.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="security-uri-schemes">
        <h2>URI Schemes</h2>
        <p>
          There are many types of URIs aside from just <code>http</code> and
          <code>https</code>.
          Some libraries which handle fetching requests at various URI schemes
          may try to be smart and reference schemes which may be undesirable,
          such as <code>file</code>.
          Client and server authors should carefully check how their libraries
          handle requests, and potentially whitelist only certain safe URI
          types, such as <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="security-spam">
        <h2>Spam</h2>
        <p>
          Spam is a problem in any network, perhaps especially so in federated
          networks.
          While no specific mechanism for combating spam is provided in
          ActivityPub, it is recommended that servers filter incoming content
          both by local untrusted users and any remote users through some
          sort of spam filter.

      <section id="security-sanitizing-content">
        <h2>Sanitizing Content</h2>
        <p>
          Any activity field being rendered for browsers (or other rich
          text enabled applications) should take care to sanitize fields
          containing markup to prevent cross site scripting attacks.

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>
        This specification comes from years of hard work and experience by a
        number of communities exploring the space of federation on the web.
        In particular, much of this specification is informed by
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/wiki/Main_Page">OStatus</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">Pump API</a>,
        as pioneered by StatusNet (now GNU Social) and Pump.io.
        Both of those initiatives were the product of many developers' hard work,
        but more than anyone, Evan Prodromou has been a constant leader in this
        space, and it is unlikely that ActivityPub would exist in something
        resembling its current state without his hard work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Owen Shepherd built the initial version of this specification, borrowed
        from the ideas in the
        <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">Pump API</a>
        document, mostly as a complete rewrite of text, but sharing most of
        the primary ideas while switching from ActivityStreams 1 to
        ActivityStreams 2.
        Jessica Tallon and Christopher Allan Webber took over as editors when
        the standard moved to the W3C Social Working Group and did the majority
        of transition from Owen's document to its current state as ActivityPub.
      </p>

      <p>
        ActivityPub has been shaped by the careful input of many members in the
        W3C Social Working Group.
        ActivityPub especially owes a great debt to Amy Guy, who has done more
        than anyone to map the ideas across the different Social Working Group
        documents through her work on the
        <a href="#bib-social-web-protocols" class="bibref">Social
          Web Protocols</a>
        overview document.
        Amy also laid out the foundations for a significant refactoring of the
        ActivityPub spec while sprinting for four days with Christopher Allan
        Webber.
        These revisions lead to cleaner separation between the client to server
        and server components, along with clarity about ActivityPub's relationship
        to [[!LDN]], among many other improvements.

        <dd>
          ActivityPub's actors may contain information about the associated
          user.
          At minimum, the actor profile contains an identifier which also
          provides a mechanism for contacting the actor, through the exposed
          actor's inbox.
          Aside from this, ActivityPub does not mandate that any personally
          identifiable information to operate, though depending on the
          implementation, any number of details may be exposed on the actor's
          profile, particularly user names and real names.
          Additionally, a notification payload could include personally
          identifiable information, depending on the implementation and use,
          but it is again not required for the core functionality to operate.

          Same implications as personally-identifiable information in
          notification payload (as mentioned above).
          The application supplies no normative mechanism for authentication
          from clients to servers, but depending on what mechanism is used,
          OAuth tokens may be exposed, particularly if HTTP is used without
          TLS/SSL support.
          Similarly, no normative mechanism for authentication between servers
          is exposed, though without TLS/SSL support, OAuth tokens could be
